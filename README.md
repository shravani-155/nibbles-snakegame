It is a simple variant of the snake video game concept. The game was very popular in mobile devices of early 21st century. The game's objective is to navigate a virtual snake through a walled-space while consuming an egg along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls and their own snake. The score increases after consuming each egg. Since the length of the snake increases with each egg consumed, the game increases in difficulty over time.
